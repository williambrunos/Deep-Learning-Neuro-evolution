# Hello there!

## Abstract 

This repository is destined to store all my studies on deep learning neural evolutions. This is a interesting study area based on the natural selection, willing to evolve weights, biases and topologies of artificial neural networks to perform a good solution of some problem set.

The idea here is to evolve these neural networks in a way that, given a problem, we don't need to worry about our topologie of the solution, the algorithm developed will do this for us based on genetic evolution.
